# Project Plan: Replicating AgentGPT with Enhanced Features

## Overview
This project aims to replicate the AgentGPT project on GitHub with additional features such as the ability to switch between different LLMs, autonomous browsing capabilities, and speech features. The application will include a frontend UI and a control panel for admin configuration. The code will be consolidated into respective files to save tokens and ensure clarity.

## Key Features
1. **Switchable LLMs**: Allow users to choose from the top 10 LLMs and top 10 open-source models.
2. **Autonomous Browsing**: Integrate browsing capabilities.
3. **Speech Features**: Add speech functionalities using Multion.
4. **Frontend UI**: Create an interactive user interface.
5. **Admin Control Panel**: Provide a control panel for managing configurations and monitoring performance.

## Documentation and Installation
Refer to the official documentation for specific installation and usage instructions before loading any of the packages:
- [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)[1](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)
- [LiveKit Documentation](https://www.livekit.io/docs/)[2](https://www.livekit.io/docs/)
- [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)[3](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

Implementation Strategy
Core AI Logic
Use LangChain to build the core AI logic and generate text responses1.
Use LiveKit to provide real-time voice and video interactions with the user2.
Multi-Agent Framework
Design the system to easily swap out models or run multiple ones concurrently.
Use multiple agents working together with some machine learning capabilities.
Control Panel
Develop a web-based interface using Django or Flask for the control panel.
Include graphs and charts to visualize agent performance and task history.
Manage tokens and API calls regularly.
Messaging System
Use RabbitMQ for the messaging system.
Consider using Celery to manage tasks and scheduling.
Frontend UI
Build an interactive user interface for seamless user interaction.
